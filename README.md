Python code for data extraction, analysis and writing to csv file

Client can enter: credit score, monthly debt, monthly income, loan amount desired, and home value.  The formula provided will calculate what loans the client is eligible for.

I added a test.csv file for python to write to for test data.

Client can choose which csv file to write the data to

New file options:  test.csv and qualifying_loans.csv

Thank you
